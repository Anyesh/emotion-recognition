## About the company

**Q1. ABC Pvt. Ltd. is a very popular company that runs an e-commerce website. Is there anything else we need to know about the company?**

We are the rising e-commerce company. We have more than 100,000 customers who use our app every day and are return users.

**Q2. Well, some of the e-commerce websites focus on a certain category of items/products. Are you more focused on specific products/services or do you sell general items?**

Currently, we sell fancy clothing items.

We aim to best understand our customers and provide them with the best services. Business-wise our main goal is to increase our brand reputation and sales by improving the perception of a customer.

## Context of the product/existing system

**Q1. Briefly tell us your system needs? What do you need?**

We would like you to build an emotion detection and recognition system which will recognize the emotions of our customer’s valuable feedback.

**Q2. Why do you need this new system? What are your business needs?**

As we have said earlier, we need to know our customers better. There are thousands of feedbacks daily from our customers and it is impossible to analyze all of them. So, we need such a system, which will prepare a summary of the sentiment report according to our products.

**Q3. Is there any existing system to solve this problem?**

We don’t have any such automation system. Our sellers used to analyze some of the feedback manually.

**Q4. How is the existing system helping to solve the problem? (If Any)**

Manual analysis is tedious and time-consuming.

**Q5. What features do you like in the existing system? (If Any)**

We like how humans can understand emotions just from reading the text. We want our new system to mimic similar behavior.

**Q6. What features you don’t like about the existing system? (If Any)**

## About the new system/product

**Q1. Well, there are basically 6 types of human emotion: sad, happy, surprise, disgust, fear, and anger. Do you think all these emotions are expressed in the product review? Can you please tell us, addressing which of these emotional aspects are more important for your product/company?**

As of our experience, most of the review contains the emotion of happy, sad, disgust, and anger. We don’t think there was any review with the emotion of fear.

**Q2. Assume that you have a product that can distinguish different emotions, then how are you going to use this product? For example, will you act based on the emotions level or do you just want to know how satisfied are your customers/ how good is your service?**

The main goal of this new system will be to understand our customers better and hence our service. We want to know how satisfied our customers are. We also want to improve our service by understanding the feedback from our customers.

**Q3. What other features do you need from this new system?**

We want a feature to be added in the admin panel of our existing e-commerce site. After integration of new features, we must be able to see satisfaction/emotion of per customers level/ on product level/ and on review level. We haven’t discussed additional features as of now.

**Q4. Can you tell me about the functional and nonfunctional requirements?**

Well I have already discussed the functional requirements. As per now, we have not thought anything about non-functional requirements.

**Q5. Can you please order features based on priorities? Or can you classify must-have, should-have, and could-have features?**

All features as I have already discussed are must-have features. We want to measure emotion on a per customer level/ per customer level and on as per review level. As of now, we haven’t discussed more features that could be of less priority.

**Q6. How will you and your-customer be benefited from this new system?**

Well we want to improve our service. This will directly benefit our customers. On the other hand, satisfied customers are always better for our good and business to expand.

**Q7. Do you have any acceptance criteria? If any, what are they?**

We will give some feedback as input to the system you have built. We will then see how your system will perform on those feedback. We will keep those feedbacks hidden from you. As of now we will see few feedback annually. We are also discussing more about acceptance criteria. Roughly talking about accuracy it should be over 80%. We will tell you about the precision and recall score later.
